        Convert Miles to Kilometers

        On December 25th, 2021 the Web Space Telescope was launched from earth and will reach its
        destination at the L2 Lagrange point. This point is approximately 900,000 miles from earth
        and will take about 30 days to complete the journey. A Lagrange point is a point in space at
        which a small body, under the gravitational influence of two large ones, will remain
        approximately at rest relative to them.

        See: https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html

        Write a program using JavaScript to convert miles to kilometers:

        1. Input: Prompt user to enter some number of miles
        2. Calculate: Convert miles to kilometers
        3. Output: Display the user input and the calculated output in the UI.

        Given: Conversion factor is 1.60934

    */

    // define constants
    const CONVERSION_FACTOR = 1.60934;

    // collect input
    let miles = prompt("Enter miles:",10);

    // perform calculations

    // display output
