        Taco Time Drive-Thru

        In October 1933, White Star Cafeteria created a week-long campaign in order to let locals know that they
        were offering "Mexican tacos" each Tuesday. Throughout the next several decades, a number of restaurants
        had designated Tuesday as the day for special deals on tacos.

        Write the following program using JavaScript to compute your "Taco Tuesday" order:

            1. Input: Prompt the user to enter some number of tacos.
            2. Input: Prompt the user to enter some number of burritos.
            3. Calculate: Compute the subtotal, sales tax amount, and grand total.
            4. Output: Display the data values in the UI where prompted in the <span> tags.

        Given:
            • Tacos cost $1.19
            • Burritos cost $2.49
            • Sales tax is 6.5%

        HINT: you use + for addition and * for multiplication

    */

    // define constants

    // collect input into variables

    // perform calculations

    // display output
