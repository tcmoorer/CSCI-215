    Prime Number Checker

    A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
    For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are the first few prime numbers. Write a JavaScript program that
    will accept a single numeric value and determine if it is a prime number or not. For cases
    when the number is not a prime number include all divisors.

    The solution should include the following elements:

    - use Bootstrap's grid for layout
    - use input field to receive the number
    - validate that the value from the user is a number, display a 'danger' alert if needed
    - use an event to call a function that performs the prime check and displays the result
